[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xealits/symbolic-lisp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xealits/symbolic-lisp)

A small lisp-based macro system for a couple 8-bit electronics projects.

The goal is:

* to make simple, practical metaprogramming features easily accessible
* facilitate the metaprogramming procedures over the usual ones
* have an easily extensible system.

It should facilitate programming a couple electronics projects.
But the system can also work as a fun shell program or a mini glue-language.
